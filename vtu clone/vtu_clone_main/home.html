                University of BDT College of Engineering is one of the oldest Engineering Colleges of Karnataka, 
                has always been a centre of learning among the middle and poorer sections of society. 
                We have always been trying to maintain higher standards of technical 
                Education with a working group of highly motivated and Learned Faculty Members.
                In the present scenario, technical education is playing a very important role in the overall development of our country. 
                Achievements in the areas of Information Technology, Computer Science, IoT and Digital
                 Communication have put a larger resposibility on the shoulders of present day engineering students.
                  Innovative thinking, hard work, skill development, workman ship development and mastery in soft skills are some of the expectations of the present day industry. 
                  Our students have to come up to these expectations.

            <p class="text-sm">
                University BDT College of Engineering (UBDTCE), Davanagere, is located in the central part of Karanataka (State), India.
                 Started in the year 1951, it was the only Government Engineering College in the state. 
                 The College was named after the donors Bramhappa Devendrappa Tanvanappanavar (BDT),
                 who donated 1.5 lakh rupees for the construction of buildings.
                 Subsequently, the College building was completed and inaugurated on September 24, 1956.
                 The College continued as the only Government Engineering College (GBDTCE) affiliated to 
                 University of Mysore, for the entire state of Karnataka until it was transferred to Kuvempu University on June 1, 1992,
                 as a Constituent Engineering College. Later on, with the establishment of Davangere University,
                 UBDTCE became its Constituent Engineering College on August 18, 2009. 
                 Again, the College was transferred to Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Belgaum, on February 24, 2011 as its first Constituent Engineering College.<br>
